[![GitHub tag (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-influx.svg?label=latest)](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-influx/releases/latest)
![Terraform Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/tf-%3E%3D0.12.0-blue.svg)

This repo contains the **official** module for deploying the [TICK Stack](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/) on [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/) using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Packer](https://www.packer.io/).

## TICK Stack Architecture

![TICK multi-cluster architecture](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-influx/blob/master/_docs/tick-multi-cluster-architecture.png?raw=true)

## Features

- Deploy the TICK stack (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, Kapacitor) to gather and process time series data.
- Supports both InfluxDB Enterprise and OSS
- Supports colocated clusters and separate clusters

## What is TICK Stack?

The TICK Stack is a loosely coupled yet tightly integrated set of open source projects designed to handle massive amounts of time-stamped information to support your metrics analysis needs.

Collectively, [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf), [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb), [Chronograf](https://github.com/influxdata/chronograf) and [Kapacitor](https://github.com/influxdata/kapacitor) are known as the TICK Stack.

## Learn

This repo is a part of [the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library](https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/), a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you’ve never used the Infrastructure as Code Library before, make sure to read [How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library](https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/)!

### Repo organisation

This repo has the following folder structure:

* [root](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-influx): The root folder contains an example of how to deploy InfluxDB OSS. See
  [influxdb-oss](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-influx/tree/master/examples/influxdb-oss) for the documentation.
* [modules](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-influx/tree/master/modules): This folder contains the main implementation code for this Module, broken down into multiple standalone submodules.
* [examples](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-influx/tree/master/examples): This folder contains examples of how to use the submodules.
* [test](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-influx/tree/master/test): Automated tests for the submodules and examples.

See [how to use this repository](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-google-influx/blob/master/core-concepts.md#using-this-repository) to configure and deploy TICK Stack.
